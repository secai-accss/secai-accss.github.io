# ACCSS - Working Group Security & AI

The **Working Group Security & AI (Sec&AI)** represents all Dutch academic institutions where cybersecurity research is conducted using artificial intelligence. Our objective is to bring together cybersecurity and AI experts addressing security challenges from technical, legal, and governmental perspectives.

The [2nd ACCSS Security & AI Workshop on Generative AI](/workshop) will take place on 23 October 2025 at the TU Delft, please find all information [here](/workshop).

## Objective
We aim to foster collaboration between Dutch research institutes working at the intersection of security and artificial intelligence by bringing together researchers across disciplines, including technical, humanities, and policy-making, to address security and AI challenges. This working group acts as a central hub to connect researchers from different backgrounds, encourage joint proposal writing, connect PhD students needing expertise from adjacent fields, and share recent advancements in the field.

By bringing researchers together, we provide participants with an overview of current advancements, develop a shared vision for the future direction of secure AI solutions, and plan future projects. Moreover, this collaboration allows the Security & AI working group to serve as a point of contact for policymakers and industry, ensuring a positive impact on societal questions related to the field.

In short, our key objectives are:
1. **Networking and Interdisciplinary Collaboration**: Our workgroup serves as a network hub, bringing together expertise from various domains beyond pure AI and security, effectively bridging multiple disciplines.
2. **Central Point of Contact**: We act as a central point of contact for public and private organizations seeking guidance on the integration of security and AI, helping them find the best-fit experts for their needs.
3. **Policy Support and Vision**: We develop a shared vision that aids policymakers in formulating informed positions on the use and security of AI solutions. 

## Organisation
We strive for a meeting circuit that fits seamlessly with the existing organization of ACCSS. To connect researchers in our focus area, we bootstrap an annual workshop regarding Security & AI. During this workshop, we exchange previous results, brainstorm on potential collaborations for upcoming funding calls (faculty), connect PhD students working in overlapping domains, and share lessons learned from educational curricula. Moreover, members of the working group will be invited to a semi-annual meet-up to discuss potential funding opportunities and collaborations.
